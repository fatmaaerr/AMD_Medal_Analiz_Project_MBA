# AMD_Medal_Analiz_Project_MBA


The aim of this project is to develop a system for identifying frequent itemsets and conducting market basket analysis on the Medal dataset. Specifically, the analysis focuses on treating text as baskets and words as items, with the goal of identifying patterns and relationships within the dataset. To achieve this, we applied the Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm, which allowed us to identify frequent item sets and association rules. By conducting this analysis, we gained valuable insights into the structure and content of the dataset, which can inform future research and decision-making.


In the project, we obtained data from Kaggle and utilized it for our analyses. The data preparation and analysis files are available below.
